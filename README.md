# 👋 Hi — I’m Guillaume Henon-Just  
**@GuillaumeHJ** — Machine Learning engineer & researcher (MVA, ENS & École des Ponts ParisTech)  
I’m preparing a transition toward a **PhD in Machine Learning applied to Biology**. My background spans research-oriented projects in CV, **RL, GNNs,** semi-supervised learning, **industrial research at Valeo**, and a **5-month research stay at OIST (Japan)** where I worked on **deep learning–based blind source separation for music** using architectures inspired by computer vision. I’m especially motivated to apply **GNNs and RL** to biological and chemical systems.

## 📂 Selected Projects

### 🔹 1. CoVR — Composed Video/Image Retrieval  
**Repo:** https://github.com/GuillaumeHJ/CoVR  
Investigated how to improve multimodal embedding fusion for composed retrieval tasks. The goal was to build more flexible models capable of combining text, video, and image representations efficiently for large-scale retrieval scenarios.

### 🔹 2. Semi-Supervised Segmentation of CT Scans  
**Repo:** https://github.com/GuillaumeHJ/Semi-Supervised-Segmentation-of-CT-Scans  
Addressed the challenge of limited annotations in medical imaging by exploring semi-supervised segmentation strategies. The project focused on scalable clinical workflows where annotated data is scarce and unlabeled data is abundant.

### 🔹 3. RL for HIV Treatment Control  
**Repo:** https://github.com/GuillaumeHJ/RL-HIV-Treatment-Control  
Worked on reinforcement learning–based strategies for optimal treatment scheduling in HIV therapy. The objective was to model clinical decision-making under constraints and design agents that balance drug efficacy and patient well-being.
